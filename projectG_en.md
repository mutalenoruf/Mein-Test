AI and Me – A Dialogue About Collaboration and Common Sense
(English)
Artificial intelligence is a tool — powerful, impressive, and sometimes delightfully unpredictable.
To highlight the importance of human oversight, I intentionally pushed an AI into an “absurdly dumb mode.” The dialogue below isn’t just a joke; it’s an experiment that reveals how quickly systems can derail when guided poorly.
For me, this illustrates a simple truth:
Safe and meaningful AI requires collaboration — human judgment and machine capability working together.
This dialogue offers a playful glimpse into how I work with AI: curious, reflective, and always aware that technology should support people, not replace them.
